## üü∞ Ingredient Cost Formula

- `uom_qty` = 1
- `packaging_size` = from the database || from the user if new || 1
- `ttp` = from the database || from the user if new
- `prep_qty` = from the user
- `yield` = from the user
- `ingredient_modifier` = `uom_qty` / `packaging_size` \* `prep_qty` \* (1 + (1 - `yield`))
- `ingredient_cost` = `ingredient_modifier` \* `ttp`
- `ingredient_qty` = `prep_qty` \* (1 + (1 - `yield`))

- ### üê¨ SQL DB Migration: Order of files that need to be migrated

  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** It is recommended to migrate the files one by one for lesser risk of migration error.
    - Use command: `php artisan migrate --path=the/relative/path/of/migration/file.php`
    - If not applicable, or you don't want to migrate them one by one, do these:
      1. Create a backup copy of migration files of sql views only.
      2. Delete the migration files for sql views.
      3. Run `php artisan migrate:status` to check the status of migration files.
      4. Run `php artisan migrate` to migrate the files without the sql views. You can run `php artisan migrate:status` to check if all are migrated.
      5. Copy the backup migration files again to db migration folder: `database/migrations`.
      6. Run `php artisan migrate` once more and it should be good.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Make sure that the sql views are the last ones to be migrated to the database as they require some tables to already exist before it can be migrated.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Make sure that you follow the order of these sql files when migrating them.
