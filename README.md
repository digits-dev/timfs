## üü∞ Ingredient Cost Formula

- `uom_qty` = 1
- `packaging_size` = from the database || from the user if new || 1
- `ttp` = from the database || from the user if new
- `prep_qty` = from the user
- `yield` = from the user
- `ingredient_modifier` = `uom_qty` / `packaging_size` \* `prep_qty` \* (1 + (1 - `yield`))
- `ingredient_cost` = `ingredient_modifier` \* `ttp`
- `ingredient_qty` = `prep_qty` \* (1 + (1 - `yield`))
